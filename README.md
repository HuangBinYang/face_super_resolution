# 	CS-E4890 - Deep Learning

Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial with WGAN-GP loss.

Project for CS-E4890 - Deep Learning course in Aalto University.

### Contents

The main two scripts are:
* `main.py` - training script
* `compare.py` - generating super-resolution reconstructions

There is pretrained model uploaded and example images, so you can generate super-resolution images right away!


### Running
Install Conda environment from `env.yml`, read command line arguments in the beginning of `main.py`/`compare.py` scripts, run and have fun!

Running `python compare.py` with default arguments will generate images for you instantaneously :)
